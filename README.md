# BlackJack
Monte Carlo Exploration start (MCES) problem on BlackJack with ace = 11 all the time
MCES with UCB ( upper confidence bound) method on BlackJack with ace = 1 all the time

Assumptions:
1.  dealer sticks only with 18 or more, and otherwise hits
2.  the probability of drawing a 10 value is always 4/13.  the probabilities of drawing 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 values are all 1/13.  
3.  ace counts as 11
4.  For the initial action in an episode, assume hit and stay are equally likely
